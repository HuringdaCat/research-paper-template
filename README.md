## Getting Started

1.  **Install Quarto:** If you don't have Quarto installed, follow the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/).
2.  **Edit Content:**
    -   Open `paper.qmd` to modify the main document flow.
    -   Edit individual sections within the `sections/` directory.
    -   Update `bibliography.bib` with your references.
    -   Place your figures in the `figures/` directory.
    -   Add supplementary materials to the `supplements/` directory.
3.  **Render the Document:** To render the paper to your desired format (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX), navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run: `bash     quarto render` This command will generate `paper.pdf`, `paper.docx`, and other output formats as configured in `quarto.yml` and `paper.qmd`.

## Customization

-   **`quarto.yml`:** Modify this file to change project-wide options, output formats, and other Quarto settings.
-   **`paper.qmd`:** Adjust the YAML front matter in this file to control document-specific settings, metadata, and citation styles.
-   **`bibliography.bib`:** Manage your references using BibTeX. You can use tools like Zotero or Mendeley to export your citations to this format.
