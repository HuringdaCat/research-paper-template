# Research Paper Template

This is a research paper template built using Quarto, designed to streamline the process of writing academic papers. It provides a structured environment for organizing your content, managing citations, and generating professional-looking output in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Quarto:** If you don't have Quarto installed, follow the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/).
2.  **Edit Content:**
    -   Open `paper.qmd` to modify the main document flow.
    -   Edit individual sections within the `sections/` directory.
    -   Update `bibliography.bib` with your references.
    -   Place your figures in the `figures/` directory.
    -   Add supplementary materials to the `supplements/` directory.
3.  **Render the Document:** To render the paper to your desired format (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX), navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run: `bash     quarto render` This command will generate `paper.pdf`, `paper.docx`, and other output formats as configured in `_quarto.yml` and `paper.qmd`.

## Customization

-   **`_quarto.yml`:** Modify this file to change project-wide options, output formats, and other Quarto settings.
-   **`paper.qmd`:** Adjust the YAML front matter in this file to control document-specific settings, metadata, and citation styles.
-   **`bibliography.bib`:** Manage your references using BibTeX. You can use tools like Zotero or Mendeley to export your citations to this format.

## In-Text Citations

Quarto uses Pandoc's citation syntax for in-text citations. The bibliography is defined in `_quarto.yml` and references are stored in `bibliography.bib`.

### Citation Syntax

| Type | Syntax | Output Example |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Parenthetical | `[@smith2022example]` | (Smith and Doe 2022) |
| Narrative | `@smith2022example` | Smith and Doe (2022) |
| Multiple sources | `[@smith2022example; @jones2021]` | (Smith and Doe 2022; Jones 2021) |
| With page number | `[@smith2022example, p. 5]` | (Smith and Doe 2022, 5) |
| Suppress author | `[-@smith2022example]` | (2022) |

### Examples

**Parenthetical citation** (author and year in parentheses):
```markdown
Previous research has established foundational concepts in this field [@smith2022example].
```

**Narrative citation** (author as part of the sentence):
```markdown
As noted by @smith2022example, several questions remain unanswered.
```

### Custom Citation Styles

To use a different citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago, IEEE), download a CSL file from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) and add it to your `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
bibliography: bibliography.bib
csl: apa.csl  # or any other CSL file
```
